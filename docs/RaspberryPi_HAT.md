# Raspberry: Sense-HAT to AWS-IoT
For this project, we will sample the different sensors included on the board and publish their values in AWS.
You will also be able to send different commands from the MQTT.fx interface that will be received on your Raspberry.

The Sense HAT will take measurements of your sensors by publishing them in the shadow,
showing them also in the LED display.

## What is MQTT
[MQTT](references_mqtt.md) is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol.
It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport.

The first concept is the publish and subscribe system.
A device can publish a message on a topic,
or it can be subscribed to a topic to receive messages

AWS use this system to communicate with your devices.

Access to IoT Core in AWS Management Console and go to the left navigation pane. Select Manage, and then choose Things.

When you pick a thing you can find out the different topic that you can subscribe/publish

Select **Interact** to inspect them.

&#x1F4CD;
Don't forget to copy also the Rest API, you will need it as a broker address.

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_Manage_Things_Details_Interact_MQTT.png)

At the moment, you only need to know three topics:
- Publish in this topic to update the thing shadow
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update
```
- Subscribe to this topic to check if the report was accepted
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/accepted
```
- Subscribe to this topic to check if the report was rejected
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/rejected
```

[![pic](pictures/utils/arrow_up.png)](#table-of-contents)


## How to communicate with AWS

As you know, when you register a new device in AWS, his reserved Topics are created by default,
You can use these topics for send data and receive information from the shadow.

For the time being, you only need to know a couple of them:

- topic Update
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update
```
this topic is where you publish the status of the device for update the shadow,
in this tutorial this information is composed of values sent by the Raspberry with the label **reported**

You'll also use the topic to communicate the desires to the shadow.
you must publish in the shadow like the Raspberry, but using the label **desired.**
In this case we use MQTT.fx to communicate these desires to AWS and to report the change to the device.

- topic Delta
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/delta
```
This is the channel that AWS uses to communicate to the device
the difference between the reported status and the desired status.
It is necessary that the device is subscribed to the topic.

All these status are recorded in the **shadow** of the device.
To check the current status, you should access the AWS IoT core as we taught you at the previous section.

Here you have an example:
```json
{
  "desired": {
    "command": {
      "val": "Caution",
      "colour": {
        "r": 0,
        "g": 255,
        "b": 255
      }
    }
  },
  "reported": {
    "command": {
      "colour": {
        "r": 0,
        "b": 255,
        "g": 255
      },
      "val": ""
    },
    "temp": {
      "colour": {
        "r": 143,
        "b": 0,
        "g": 0
      },
      "val": 35.861732482910156
    },
    "humidity": {
      "colour": {
        "r": 0,
        "b": 65,
        "g": 0
      },
      "val": 32.788143157958984
    }
  },
  "delta": {
    "command": {
      "val": "Caution"
    }
  }
}
```
As you can read in the above example, there are three main keys:
- "desired": It contains the desired state sent from the MQTT.fx
- "reported": It contains the status information reported by the device
- "delta": It contains the differences between the reported status and the desired status.
This is the information that is published in the delta topic.

## Test your Certificates with MQTT.fx

One of the best ways to make sure that certificates had been created correctly, it is to try connecting via a
MQTT client with graphical interface.

We recommend you download MQTT.fx from the following link https://mqttfx.jensd.de/

1. Open MQTT.fx and create a new connection.

![pic](pictures/MQTT/MQTTFX_open.png)

2. Configure the broker as shown in the image below.
Remember to use the files you downloaded in the previous step. And configure the broker address associated to your device.

![pic](pictures/MQTT/MQTTFX_Broker_Connect.png)

3. Now that you are connected to the broker, you need to subscribe to the topics accepted and rejected.

When a message is published,
you can check in these topics if the message has been **accepted** or **rejected**.
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/accepted
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/rejected
```

![pic](pictures/MQTT/MQTTFX_Topic_Subscribe.png)

4. To update your device's shadow, you should publish in the topic the following **json file**,
you can use the following link to validate it https://jsonlint.com/

```
{
    "state": {
        "reported" : {
            "temp" : 22    
        }
    }
}
```
This example simulates the publication of temperature measurements made by the device.

![pic](pictures/AWS/AWS_Console_Manage_Things_Details_Shadow.png)

5. Select the topic to update your shadow.
Be sure to select the service quality level as QoS 0, amazon doesn't allow different police.
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update
```

![pic](pictures/MQTT/MQTTFX_Topic_Publish.png)

6. If you want to delete the shadow's document publish the next **json file**
```
{
    "state": null
}
```

7. Play with this, sending different values until you understand how it works.

&#x1F44D;
Remember to check if your values has been accepted or rejected

# How to Start with the project

We will explain it to you later in detail. but in this tutorial,
first you need to be familiar with the following concepts

- Run a Python file on your raspberry
- Copy the credentials files to Raspberry
- Use MQTT.fx to post messages in a topic
- Review the shadow from AWS core

## Execute the code in your Raspberry

At this point your raspberry won't have any secrets for you.
Nevertheless we will help you to continue so that you do not have any mishap.

Create a folder on your Raspberry's desktop called **Python** and copy into it the following
[folder](../scripts/Python/Sense_HAT_AWS) and copy in the **CA** folder the device's certification files

Before, you need to edit the script configuration
[file](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iot-activation/blob/master/scripts/Python/Sense_HAT_AWS/config/Config_HAT.yaml).

```yaml
# selection to the AWS connection from the connection file
Connection: AWS

#takes a measurement every x seconds
sample : 30

#Sense HAT board configuration
Sense_HAT:
    temperature:
      active: ok        # enables/disables the taking of measurements
      msg: temperature  # text shown on the display
      max: 100          # value with maximum light intensity
      min: 0            # value with minimum light intensity
    humidity:
      active: ok
      msg: humidity
      max: 60
      min: 0
    pressure:
      active: no
      msg: pressure
      max: 0
      min: 0
    acceleration:
      active: no
      msg: accel
      max: 60
      min: 0
```
You also need to edit the configuration
[file](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iot-activation/blob/master/scripts/Python/Sense_HAT_AWS/config/Config_Cloud.yaml).
Pay attention to configure your device and select for the connection to AWS as well as the topics and messages.

```yaml
connection:
  cloud: AWS  #select your broker and the thing
  things: "MyRaspberryPi"
  broker: "xxxxxxxxxxxx-ats.iot.xx-xxxx-x.amazonaws.com"
  port: 8883
  Certificate: # identify the name of your files and the path
    path: "CA/"
    ca: "AmazonRootCA1.pem"
    certificate: "xxxxxxxxxx-certificate.pem.crt"
    private_key: "xxxxxxxxxx-private.pem.key"
  topic:   # copy here the list of topics
    update: "$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update"
    delta: "$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/delta"
    accepted: "$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/accepted"
    rejected: "$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/rejected"
```

&#x1F44D;
Depending on Phyton's interpreter version, there may be conflicts when accessing a library.

Install the libraries from your folder directory with the commands:

```
sudo pip install paho-mqtt
sudo pip install json
sudo pip install Pyaml
```

[![pic](pictures/utils/arrow_up.png)](#table-of-contents)


## Send Command from MQTT.fx

The first thing you need to know is that MQTT.fx is a powerful tool that allows you to both communicate
with AWS and monitor all communications between AWS and the device.
Use it whenever you have a problem or simply verify the content of a post.

Connect with the broker and configure it for publish in update and subscribe to delta.
```
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/accepted
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/update/rejected
$aws/things/MyRaspberryPi/shadow/delta
```
If you subscribe to delta, you can review the content that AWS sends to your Raspberry.
As a tip, you can subscribe to the topics **accepted** and **rejected** for check if the communication
is established or the message is rejected by the broker.

Publish the following json file to send a command to your Raspberry.
When the broker receives it, it will update the shadow of the device.
Generating a delta message that will be used by your raspberry to update his status.
Showing the command and RGB colour on the LED display.

Play trying new messages and colours. This can be very useful!

```json
{
	"state": {
		"desired": {
			"command": {
				"val": "Warning",
				"colour": {
					"r": 250,
					"g": 150,
					"b": 0
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Execute your project and enjoy!!

### Execute the Script

Great! Now you can start running the script, with the following command:

```
sudo python main.py
```

Another option is to configure your raspberry to run the script on power up

Open the cron Table with de command `crontab -e` and copy the next line in the file
```
@reboot ( sleep 60  ; /usr/bin/python2.7 /home/pi/Desktop/main.py > /home/pi/Desktop/Rasp_HAT_AWS.log )
```


### Check the Shadow state

Before starting the execution, you will see how your shadow is empty.
With this script you can make temperature and humidity measurements in the board.
This updated the shadow with each device shipment. It showing the same values as shown on the screen.


### watch the LED screen

As you will be visualizing in your display, different messages are shown for the temperature and other
sensor measurements varying the intensity of the luminosity according to the measured value,
being able to modify even the message by the configuration file.

``` yaml
Sense_HAT:
    temperature:
      active: ok            
      msg: change-text-here   # text shown on the display
      max: 100          # value with maximum light intensity
      min: 0            # value with minimum light intensity
```

The display is able to show up to different states, temperature, humidity, etc and
one last state to visualize the received command.


### Send a command

To send a command to the device, you must use the MQTT as we explained in the previous section
by using the json that we provide. You can change both the message and the background colour
using an RGB encoding (Red, Green, Blue).

You can change this instruction as many times as necessary.

## Create your Dashboards

Now, you can collect the information from your devices. But reviewing the data from the Shadow can be a tedious task.
The best option is to create a dashboard. It will allow you to visualize all the information.

![pic](pictures/freeboard/freeboard_init_dashboard.png)

There is a great availability of tools for this purpose.
But some like freeboard, it can subscribe directly to the AWS topic.
If you want to learn how, click in the next [link](AWS_dashboard.md).
